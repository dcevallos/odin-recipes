    <h1>Patacones de Colombia (Fried Plantains)</h1>
    <img src="../img/patacones.jpeg" alt="fried plantains">
    <p>These are fried plantains that have been smashed and fried a second time.
        It is essential to use very ripe plantains. This recipe is straight from 
        my Colombian mother-in-law. Enjoy!
